# *Introduction to Deep Generative Models* at Nordic ProbAI 2024

This is the material for the *Introduction to Deep Generative Models* session at [Nordic ProbAI 2024](https://nordic.probabilistic.ai).

It consists of [**slides**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EUyF5Kw5JozY8X2NtXwyUbIxskRUSei1/view?usp=sharing) and two Jupyter notebooks called `1-VAE.ipynb` and `2-Flow.ipynb`. The notebooks run out of the box in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), but it is also fairly easy to run them locally.

Prerequisite for the exercises are:
* The background material presented in the lecture.
* Programming experience in Python using PyTorch.
