# Material for "Introduction to Deep Generative Models" at ProbAI 2024

These are the two exercises for the "Introduction to Deep Generative Models" session at [ProbAI 2024](https://nordic.probabilistic.ai).

It consists of two Jupyter notebooks called `1-VAE.ipynb` and `2-Flow.ipynb`. The notebooks run out of the box in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), but it is also fairly easy to run them locally.

Prerequisite for the exercises are:
* The background material presented in the lecture.
* Programming experience in Python using PyTorch.
